## Applicant successful email
Hi there,

Thank you for applying to be part of the `[your location]` SOUP initiative.

We received a high level of applicants for the upcoming SOUP dinner, and after a competitive process we are delighted to inform you that your application has been successful.

To confirm, you have been selected as one of three projects that will present at `[your location]` SOUP `#[event number]`, taking place from [date, time and location of event]. The presentation can last up to three minutes, and will be followed by up to three questions from the audience. There will be no technology accompanying you, just a microphone, so no presenter slides or PowerPoint. 

We realise that getting up and speaking in front of a crowd is not easy, but just be yourself and tell the story behind your project - the reason you made it through the application process is because we believe you have a great story to tell!

`[if relevant]` With this in mind, we have organised a pre-SOUP meetup.

It offers us a chance to meet you, for you to meet the other presenters, and for you to receive some tips ahead of your presentation. At this session, you’ll have the opportunity to do a practice presentation and receive feedback, so if possible come prepared with a draft ready to present.

You’ll also have the chance to meet a couple of the SOUP Team and ask us questions about what to expect at the event.

The session is booked for `[date / time / location of pre-SOUP meetup]`.

If you have any trouble finding it just give me a call on `[contact number]`.

Please respond to this email to confirm you can present at SOUP, and to let us know whether you can attend the session on the `[insert date if relevant]`.

Now that you’ve made it through to present at the next event, please start spreading the word! Invite your friends, family, colleagues and whoever else to come support you at the event via the Facebook event.

Congratulations again, and we cannot wait to see you on the night!

Kind Regards,\

## Applicant rejection email

Hello,

Thank you for applying to be part of the `[your location]` SOUP initiative. 

Unfortunately there was a high level of applicants to the upcoming dinner and your project was not successful on this occasion. 

If for any reason a space becomes available we will get in touch asap to offer it to the next project on the list. At present, our judges are looking over applications on a voluntary basis and have a short time span to do so, meaning we are unable to offer any feedback on your application. This is something we’re planning to introduce and develop down the line, so apologies for that.

There is still an opportunity to be part of the night in a different way, by supporting the project. All volunteers that support the preparation of the event by donating food or helping out by lending a hand on the night have the opportunity to promote their project for 1 minute during the event to the attendees. 

Please get in touch if you would be interested in this opportunity to share your project with the audience.

`[your location]` SOUP will be held on a regular basis in the coming year and we would love for you to apply again.

Wishing you the very best with your projects and looking forward to hearing your stories in the future.

Kind Regards,\
`[Name of sender]`
