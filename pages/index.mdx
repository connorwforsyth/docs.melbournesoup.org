# How to SOUP — A comprehensive guide.

Bring your community together to connect and support grassroots ideas and projects.

## Introduction

The following is a guide to how you could organise a SOUP night in your local neighbourhood. 

Starting a SOUP is an opportunity to bring your neighbours together and support local change in your area. A SOUP night is a wholesome, fun, positive and engaging event that involves three key ingredients: good causes, good food, and good people. 

We were inspired by the original [Detroit SOUP](https://detroitsoup.buildinstitute.org/) to start up Melbourne SOUP, and in turn we hope to inspire and help people like you to kick things off and ultimately have more people enjoying SOUP nights. 

There is nothing prescriptive here, SOUP nights work best when the organisers run things their own way to fit their community. We want your SOUP to be for locals, and run by locals, in your area. So tweak what you see fit from the suggestions throughout.

We’d love to support you in launching a SOUP where you are. Do get in touch with us if you have any questions, need additional support or are curious to explore other areas aren't coverred in this guide.

Happy SOUPing,<br />
