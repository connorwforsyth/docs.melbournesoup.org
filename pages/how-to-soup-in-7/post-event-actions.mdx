# Post event activities

You will want to do a wrap-up post on social media a day or two after the event, sharing the links and/or contact details for the presenters and contributors.

It’s important to do this while it’s still fresh in the attendees’ minds, so they can connect with those they heard from at the event.

It’s always good to follow-up with the presenters two-to-three weeks after the event to find out how their night went and what they got out of it in terms of connections and advice. While one presenter does ultimately go home with money towards their project, we find that presenters usually say it’s the connections and feedback that are more valuable and therefore all presenters gain something from the opportunity.
